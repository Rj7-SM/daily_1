    <p><font size="1"> Hey guys! Today i watched this interesting movie titled <b>"The space between us"</b>. It is a sci-fi movie but it actually had a nice storyline which gave me a different perspective about the way we look at life on this earth. Isn't it strange how we just ignore the little things on earth which might just astound the one experiencing it for the first time, like even a fruit. We eat it everyday. Ever realised from where it come from and what potential it has, somewhere after you through its seeds it will grow again with the help of some water given by some farmer, somewhere in the field, with sunshine coming from space and then we are gonna eat it again. Hah! isn't it just beautiful.</font></p>
